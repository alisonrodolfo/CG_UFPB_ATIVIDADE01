### Abstract
Normally, graphs are defined through geometric primitives such as points, lines, circles, texts, etc. It may seem simple to draw a line in the video, however, this kind of routine is not as simple as it sounds. Given this, we will develop functions in conjunction with framwork, which makes writing in video memory to perform these tasks, and perform an analysis of improvements when possible, this is also important to create more efficient applications. This post consists of implementing raster algorithms for points and lines in C / C ++ language along with the GLUT and OpenGL libraries using the Framework previously made available by the teacher.

### Introduction
This article is about Activity 1 of the subject of Introduction to Computer Graphics, taught by Prof. Christian Pagot.

### Rasterizing a Point (Pixel) on the screen
A point in computing, in this case, pixel, has the following properties:

  

*   Position in plan
  
*   Color

Each device (monitor) has its own hardware specifications, and the pixel size will depend on the graphic resolution and physical size of the device. Pixel manipulation operations are essential because from this manipulation, images are constructed or altered. In addition, we can construct graphical elements more complex than a point, but, there is a sequence of actions and algorithms so that they can be constructed.

1.  Function PutPixel();

The function rasterizes a point in the video memory, receiving as parameters the position of the pixel on the screen (x, y) and its color (RGBA). Each pixel occupies 4 bytes in the video memory, whose each byte corresponds to an RGBA value. The video memory can be represented as a linear vector, having 4 times the screen size of the device. With this, we get the following function:

**offset = (x + y \* Image\_Width) \* 4;**

Understanding this, let's use the pointer **FBptr**, which initially points to the beginning of memory (0,0), with it, we will be able to point the place where we will assign the color of the Pixel.

First, let's draw some random pixels on the screen, as we can see in **The image 1**.




Now let's look more close the function destined to execute the point rasterization.
```C++
#define X_Y_IMAGE_WIDTH (x + y * IMAGE_WIDTH) * 4

void PutPixel(int x, int y, colorRGBA cor){


	if( x < 0  || y < 0  || x > IMAGE_HEIGHT || y > IMAGE_WIDTH)
	{
		return;
	
      	} else {
		FBptr[X_Y_IMAGE_WIDTH + 0] = cor.r;
		FBptr[X_Y_IMAGE_WIDTH + 1] = cor.g;
		FBptr[X_Y_IMAGE_WIDTH + 2] = cor.b;
		FBptr[X_Y_IMAGE_WIDTH + 3] = cor.a; 
	}

}    
```

The function above describes:
1. xWidth is the position of the pixel related the screen width.
2. yHeight is the position of the pixel related the screen height.
3. myRGBA is the color vector related the pixel.

The RGBA standard  to require four bytes. Each byte it is destined for the primaries color RGBA that mean RED, GREEN, BLUE and ALPHA. With this function we can draw a point on the screen like the below picture show it.

```C++
void MyGlDraw(void) { 
            PutPixel(int xWidth, int yHeight, pixRGBA); 
}      
```

```C++
void MyGlDraw(void) { 
           PutPixel( rand()%512,rand()%512,cor1); 
}

```

### Lines Rasterization
The task of drawing a pixel on the screen was a bit easy, right? Now, we have a challenge that is to draw a line and this task is not as easy as you think, but to help us, there are some algorithms that can do this for us, however it is very important to understand them.

#### Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)
Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm is the simple line generation algorithm.

Now let's look more close the DDA Algorithm.
```C++
void ddaAlgorithm(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, std::vector<int>& myRGBA) {
  float dx = x2-x1;
  float dy = y2-y1;

  float m = dy/dx;
  float b = y1 - (m*x1);

  int j = 0;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < dx; i++) {
    colorInterpolation(i, &j, dx, &myRGBA);
    putPixel(x1+i, round(m*(x1+i)+b), myRGBA);
  }
}
```
The algorithm above describe:
1. dx is the variation/range between x2 and x1 points.
2. dy is the variation/range between y2 and y1 points.
3. m is the coefficient of the line. 
4. b is the linear coefficient of the line.

The image describes a line drawn on the screen using the DDA Algorithm.

	<h5 align="center">Figure 3 - Line drawn with DDA</h5>
	<br>
</p>

The DDA Algorithm only draws in the first quadrant as you can see in the image below and is a problem if you want to draw on other areas of the screen.

#### Bresenham Algorithm
The Bresenham algorithm is another incremental scan conversion algorithm. The big advantage of this algorithm is that, it uses only integer calculations. Moving across the x axis in unit intervals and at each step choose between two different y coordinates.

Now let's look more close the Bresenham Algorithm.
```C++
  int dx = x2-x1;
  int dy = y2-y1;
  int d = 2*dy-dx;
  int incr_e = 2 * dy;
  int incr_ne = 2 * (dy-dx);
  int x = x1;
  int y = y1;
  putPixel(x,y, myRGBA);

  int j = 0;
  while(x < x2) {
    if(d <= 0) {
      d += incr_e;
      x++;
    } else {
      d += incr_ne;
      x++;
      y++;
    }
    colorInterpolation(x, &j, x2, &myRGBA);
    putPixel(x, y, myRGBA);
  }
```
However, the algorithm above only draws lines for the first octant like the DDA, that is, lines that are between 0ยบ and 45ยบ. To better exemplify a screenshot of the above running algorithm can be seen below.

<p align="center">

	<img src="./prints/bresenhamAlgorithm.png"/ width=510px height=540px>
	<h5 align="center">Figure 5 - Line drawn with Bresenham</h5>
	<br>
</p>

You can see that we have a problem however there are techniques that can draw at all quadrants of screen. this techniques is based on the differences of | DX | and | DY | related to 0. As you can see below a better demonstration of this technique.

	<br>

Using this technique we have achieved the results below:

	<h5 align="center">Figure 7 - All quadrants</h5>
	<br>
</p>

## Drawing Triangles
After we solve the problem of the quadrants we can now draw triangles by the fact that we can use all quadrants of the screen.
```C++
void drawTriangle(Vertex first, Vertex second, Vertex third, std::vector<int>& rgba) {
  bresenhamAlgorithm(first, rgba);
  bresenhamAlgorithm(second, rgba);
  bresenhamAlgorithm(third, rgba);
}
```

	<br>

## Conclusion

### Results
As we can see that the whole project gives satisfactory results and is able to draw pixels, lines and basic geometric shapes. However, there are some bugs in the interpolationColor function, meaning the color strings are not perfect and this needs a future solution.

### Challenges encountered
The great concept of how the Bresenham algorithm worked was the first challenge to understand and the second was the technique that allowed us to draw in all quadrants on the screen.
