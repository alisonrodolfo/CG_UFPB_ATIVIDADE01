#Abstract

Normally, graphs are defined through geometric primitives such as points, lines, circles, texts, etc. It may seem simple to draw a line in the video, however, this kind of routine is not as simple as it sounds. Given this, we will develop functions in conjunction with framwork, which makes writing in video memory to perform these tasks, and perform an analysis of improvements when possible, this is also important to create more efficient applications. This post consists of implementing raster algorithms for points and lines in C / C ++ language along with the GLUT and OpenGL libraries using the Framework previously made available by the teacher.

#Introduction
